Chisel
=====================

> A Parse based CMS

## Build Setup

First, you should get a [Parse local server](https://github.com/Nes-si/chisel-parse-server).

After running that, you can work with the app:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
 
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm start
 
# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

To connect to remote server, you can set it URL in user's profile.
